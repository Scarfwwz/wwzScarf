# The experience about preparing the interview

<!--写在前面：因为我觉得敲代码的时候用英文不用切换写起来更方便，所以有些会用英文写，但能力有限，所以会夹杂中文，希望不要嫌弃，嘿嘿-->

## About git

2021.10.9 I found I mistook git for github.The experience was nothing special ,just bilibili ,yyds.

## About github

I haven't heard about git ever since until I met you,so thank you very much for giving me this precious opportunity to learn about Github.

### The first step : look through the resource given

Everything is new for me so I grubbed the nearest the resource,the link you gave to us. Firstly I didn't put the assignment in the first place but to conserve some websites.

This is what I have learned.

| Website | Brief introduction              | My experience                                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Github  | Where the world builds software | Amazing! I found a completely new world where everyone in Earth is connected. Maybe I can find some finished codes here. This will save me a lot of time. |
|CSDN|专业开发者社区|==I found the answer to how to add a picture to Typora==. A website where I can find all the answer to my question. It is more professional and less popular than bilibili and 知乎.|
|C语言网|编程入门学习，实用的编程在线学习网站|More beautiful than CSDN. Specially for C language. Kind to ***vegetable birds*** like me.|

### The second step : download an app to translate English to Chinese

I successfully created my account even all were written by English.

However,it's tough to follow the guide the website gives to you because all the passage is written by English. At first I  read every word one by one myself but I found it difficult. When I was searching for the meaning of a word an idea flashed into my mind: *Why not translating all the passage?*

 So I find a treasured app : ==网易有道词典==

With the help of this app,it seemed that **我开了挂**

It even translated the picture ! Strong!!!!!



## About learning Markdown

### 1.turn to my 巨佬高中同学

毕竟是高中差一点就进省队的奆佬 , the problem is a piece of cake!

He introduce ***==Typora==*** for me and gave me this:

[大佬给我的链接]：（https://www.luogu.com.cn/blog/luogu/how-to-use-markdown）

### 2. turn to bilibili

==***bilibili  yyds!!!***==

Actually there are some practical problems and only bilibili can tell you the answer.

### 3.turn to 知乎

For review.

## About practising Markdown

I love using Typora and Markdown to keep notes!

简洁高效！我的真命软件！我的真命语法！

暑假在B站上看郝斌的网课，他都是用电脑打知识点，我用手记总是跟不上，有了Typora之后再也不担心了！！！

甚至用它自己总结了C语言第四章的知识点

有一些感悟

+ 用英文
  + “/” “<” ">"只能在英文模式下才能打出来，所以来回转换很麻烦，所以英语真的很重要
+ 打空格
  + 网课上的老师在教格式的时候强调打空格很重要，虽然只是起到美观但真的很重要。然而因为软件升级了所以敲完一行代码之后软件会自动把空格打出来，但Typora不会，为了让笔记好看一点，我学会了打空格。
+ 更新自己
  + 用电脑记笔记又快又高效，人需要不断更新自己，学习计算机更需要这种能力。

## About my expectations about 程序部

+ ability

End my assignment with a sentence I like very much:

> 在计算领域中，把显而易见的转变为有实用价值的，这一过程是“挫折”的体现。
